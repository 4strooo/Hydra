Hydra is a game that fills an interesting niche, that of first-person dungeon crawlers that play in real time. In addition, Hydra also contains a handful of mechanics that are common in roguelike, and soulslike games. The vision for the game is to neatly encapsulate the feel and atmosphere of dungeon crawling in a single immersive experience that Hydra will provide.
